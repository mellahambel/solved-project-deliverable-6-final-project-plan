While taking all business and project parameters into consideration, make quality assumptions to support the following requirements.

Your goal is to have the project approved by the executive team. The project plan should be very detailed, which is appropriate to accomplish the monumental task of implementation; however, the executive team is only interested in a thirty (30) minute summation. Therefore, you also must create a compelling executive summary that is supported by your detail that convinces the executive team that it should move forward with your solution.
